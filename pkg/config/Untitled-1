master:
  criteria:
    branches:

      ignore:
      - /.*/
    tags:
      only:
      - /v[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*(\-.+)?/

# Rules:

We decide on the basis of tag if one is specified. If one is not specified, then
we decide on the basis of branch. This means "" is not a valid tag that we might
end up evaluating, but "" IS a valid branch.

1. A pipeline will only execute if it has criteria OF SOME SORT. i.e. Pipelines
   that specify no criteria never execute.

2. 

By default all pipelines execute unless we cannot find it on the whitelist or
CAN find it on the blacklist.

# PR

branch: ""; tag: ""

This will be determined on the basis of branch.

1. test: We implicitly match the whitelist. We explicitly do not match the black list.
2. master: We explicitly do not match the whitelist.
3. releae: We implicitly match the whitelist. We explicitly match the black list.

# Merge to master

branch: "master"; tag: ""

This will be determined on the basis of branch.

1. test: 
2. master:
3. releae

# Release

branch: "master"; tag: "v0.0.1"

This will be determined on the basis of tag.

1. test: 
2. master:
